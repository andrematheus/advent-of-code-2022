# Advent of Code 2022

My attempt at solving [Advent of Code 2022 Puzzles](https://adventofcode.com/2022) using [Rust](https://rust-lang.com).

## Running

Each problem is a separate binary that includes its input statically, to run it simply run the binary, either using cargo:

    cargo run PROBLEM

E.g. `cargo run day1` or by building the project and running the corresponding binary.
